# Trading Bot - High-Performance Trading System

## Overview
This repository hosts a high-performance trading system designed for advanced algorithmic trading. It evolves a basic trading bot into a robust, scalable architecture leveraging deep reinforcement learning, statistical arbitrage, dynamic market making, and comprehensive risk management. The system is modular, optimized for real-time execution, and built for reliability in volatile markets.

## Features
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Implements PPO, SAC, and DQN agents for adaptive trading strategies.
- **Statistical Arbitrage**: Advanced cointegration models, pairs trading, and mean reversion strategies.
- **Dynamic Market Making**: Avellaneda-Stoikov model for optimal bid-ask spreads and market microstructure analysis.
- **Risk Management**: Real-time VaR, CVaR, stress testing, and intelligent circuit breakers.
- **Execution Optimization**: Smart order routing, TWAP/VWAP algorithms, and slippage minimization.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based dashboard, structured logging, and multi-channel alerts.
- **Data Infrastructure**: Streaming data feeds, normalization, and high-performance storage.
